# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills, experience, and the projects I’ve worked on as a web developer. It's designed to give you an insight into my work and how I approach development. 

## Project Overview

This portfolio is a fully responsive and interactive website, built to highlight my technical abilities and design sensibilities. It includes sections that demonstrate my experience, skills, and the various projects I’ve completed. It also features a contact form powered by **EmailJS**, where visitors can reach out to me directly.

I built this portfolio with the goal of providing an engaging and professional way for potential clients, collaborators, or employers to learn more about me and my work. The design and functionality have been tailored to create a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the portfolio looks great on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Interactive Contact Form**: Users can submit messages directly from the portfolio via **EmailJS**.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Automatic scrolling to the top of the page when navigating between sections.
- **Project Showcases**: A selection of projects I’ve worked on, with descriptions and links to live sites or GitHub repositories.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio was built with the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles for layout and design, using a combination of flexbox, grid, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (React)**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **React Router**: For managing page navigation and routing.
- **EmailJS**: For handling form submissions and sending messages directly from the contact form.
